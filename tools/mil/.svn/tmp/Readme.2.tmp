Multiple Instance Learning Matlab toolbox. (version 0.7.8)

This toolbox is an add-on to the PRTools toolbox. The toolbox contains
algorithms to train, investigate, visualize and evaluate multiple
instance learning classifiers. Realize that this toolbox is quite
preliminary still, because I am still not sure if the structure and
the coding choices that I made are sensible. But the code works:-)

Graphical representation how to get from a collection of bags of
instances, to a label per bag:

          +------------------------- std.cl. --- Nx2 --- milcombine
MIL dataset                                                |
(instances) -- milvector -- Bxp'---- std.cl ------------ dataset
  Nxp      --- milkernel -- BxB -- kernel.cl ------------ Bx2   
                                                           | 
          +------------------------- mil.cl ---------------+

N: total nr of objects    p: dimensionality
B: number of bags

There are three 'extra' converter MIL tools:
milcombine : combine the outputs by a standard classifier on the individual
             instances
           shortcut: simple_mil(w) = w*milcombine
milvector  : compute a feature vector from a bag of instances
           shortcut: vector_mil(w) = milvector*w
milkernel  : compute (dis)similarities between bags
           shortcut: sv_mil(w) = milkernel*svc


To get the most out of this toolbox, some experience with the PRTools
toolbox is recommended.  This toolbox is developed as a research tool so
no guarantees can be given.

- Requirements:

In order to make this toolbox work, you need:
0. A computer and some enthusiasm
1. PRTools 4.1.0 or higher
2. This toolbox.

- Installation:

The installation of the toolbox is almost trivial. Unzip the file, store
the contents in a directory (name it for instance MIL) and add this
directory to your matlab path.

- Information and example code:

For the most basic information, type  help MIL (use the directory
name where the toolbox is stored). Some simple example is given in
tstmusk.m.


* Notes on version 0.7.8
- Fixed the milvector.m. It is now a trained mapping, instead of a fixed
  one. It also introduced a mountain of other problems (giving a
  cell-array as an imput parameter caused problems for prtools, so that
  is changed as well).
- Removed the combineobjects.m 
- Extended this README
- Added getwnames.m to make the examle work, and renamed nrbags to
  nrfolds in the tstmusk.
- Fixed the computation of the operating point in the milroc.
- Added the weighted logistic regression, and the boosting_mil (still
  needs some debugging and optimizion I think...)
- Added the miSVM.
- Added the Earth Mover's distance to milproxm


* Notes on version 0.7.7
- Added this README
- Put this on the webpage
